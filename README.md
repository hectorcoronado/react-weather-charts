# react-weather-charts

## This is intended to be used as a reference app. As such, the codebase will include:

* Dead code (commented out) that has been re-factored. E.g. a Functional
	component that has been re-factored to a Class based component.
* Copious (over-abundant & **very** verbose) explanatory comments that detail,
	sometimes minutely, the purpose of (e.g.) a line or block of code.

**A more readable codebase can be found in the "clean" branch of this repo.**

## Some React (& otherwise) concepts that can be gleaned from this app are:

* Redux
* Asynchronous calls (AJAX calls via Axios & ReduxPromise)
* Integration of GoogleMaps

This app follows the code from [this](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content) Udemy course by @StephenGrider.
